# Quantum Error Mitigation
Writing code to understand quantum error mitigation via zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE)

## Setup:
Initialize virtual environment:  
`python3 -m venv venv`

Activate virtual environment:  
`source venv/bin/activate`

Install necessary packages:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Goals:
1. Build out 3 variations of ZNE, namely local folding, global folding, pulse stretching
2. Build out at least 3 variations of extrapolation, namely linear and exponential extrapolation (TODO Add one more method)
3. Include visualizer that plots out extrapolated values and circuit diagrams
